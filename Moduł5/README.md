# Module 5: Optimization and Performance

## Lesson 1: Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

### Theory:

- **Lazy Loading**: How to load components on demand to improve application performance.

  - Documentation: [Vue.js Lazy Loading](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html)

### Example:

`js

const Foo = () => import('./Foo.vue');

export default {

  components: {

    Foo

  }

}

` 

### Step-by-step Task:

1. Implement lazy loading for a component in your Vue application.

2. Test the performance improvement using browser developer tools.

3. Optimize other parts of your application using code splitting.

### Detailed Task:

Create a Vue application with multiple routes and implement lazy loading for each route component.

### Advanced Task:

Optimize a large application by implementing lazy loading, code splitting, and performance monitoring.
